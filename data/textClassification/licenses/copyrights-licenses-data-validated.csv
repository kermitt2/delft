": « The key and novel American contribution to jurisprudence has been that begun by the Poundian paradigm and developed by the legal realists. Not only has it been an original contribution, but its legacy is the vibrant and leading role of American jurisprudence in law today. Almost all modern schools of thought owe a substantial debt to this American contribution, which is now causing legal scholars outside the United States to reorient their work and teaching », B.
